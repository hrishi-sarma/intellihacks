# Quantum-Enhanced Trading System Architecture
This architecture outlines a modular, multi-layered trading system powered by quantum optimization, AI agents, and a feedback loop for continuous learning.

# Architecture Overview
1. Data Layer
  This layer ingests and processes raw financial and alternative data for feature extraction.
  Market and Alternative Data
  Data Ingestion Agent: Prepares data for downstream usage
  Raw Data Store: Stores unprocessed data
  Feature Agent: Converts raw data to usable features
  Feature Store: Central hub of engineered features

2. Analysis Layer
  Responsible for decision-making using AI and quantum agents.
  Quantum Optimization Agent: Generates optimal portfolio weights
  Risk Agent: Adjusts orders based on risk assessment
  Strategy Agents: Generate trade signals based on analysis

4. Execution Layer
   Executes trade decisions while ensuring compliance.
   Orchestration Agent: Manages execution flow
   Execution Agent: Sends orders to brokers
   Broker API: Communicates with the financial markets
   Compliance Agent: Verifies regulatory compliance

5. Feedback and Optimization Layer
   Continuously improves the system using feedback loops.
   Feedback Agent: Monitors performance and outcomes
   Retraining Triggers: Detects when models need updating
   Strategy / Quantum Agents: Retrained based on performance

# Key Highlights
  - Quantum Optimization for portfolio balancing
  - AI Strategy Agents that evolve over time
  - Real-time Execution with compliance checks
  - Feedback Loop enables self-improvement through retraining triggers
